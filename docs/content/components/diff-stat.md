## Diffstat

Diffstats show how many deletions or additions a diff has. It's typically a row of 5 blocks that get colored with green or red.

```html live
<span class="diffstat tooltipped tooltipped-e" aria-label="6 changes: 3 additions &amp; 3 deletions">
  6
  <span class="diffstat-block-added"></span><span class="diffstat-block-added"></span><span class="diffstat-block-deleted"></span><span class="diffstat-block-deleted"></span><span class="diffstat-block-neutral"></span>
</span>
```

Use the `color-fg-success` and `color-fg-danger` utilities to add additional information about the size of the diff.

```html live
<span class="diffstat">
    <span class="color-fg-success">+7</span>
    <span class="color-fg-danger">âˆ’2</span>
    <span class="tooltipped tooltipped-e" aria-label="9 lines changed">
      <span class="diffstat-block-added"></span><span class="diffstat-block-added"></span><span class="diffstat-block-added"></span><span class="diffstat-block-deleted"></span><span class="diffstat-block-neutral"></span>
    </span>
</span>
```
